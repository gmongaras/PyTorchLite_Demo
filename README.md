# PyTorchLite_Demo
Demo for PyTorch Lite on Android for an article I wrote on Medium. The article can be found at the following link:

This repo has two main sections:
- The android app which integrates a number generation model and an image generation model into an android app
- The Python directory which generates a new number generation model and has code to create an mobile image generation model from a 
stylegan3 model. The script to do this is called optimize.py and is found in the 
[root directory of the stylegan clone](https://github.com/gmongaras/PyTorchLite_Demo/blob/main/Python/stylegan3-main/optimize.py)
